> A Progressive Web App uses modern web capabilities to deliver an app-like user experience. They evolve from pages in browser tabs to immersive, top-level apps, maintaining the web's low friction at every moment.

## PWA's are:

* **Progressive** - Work for every user, regardless of browser choice because they’re built with progressive enhancement as a core tenet.

* **Responsive** - Fit any form factor, desktop, mobile, tablet, or whatever is next.

* **Connectivity independent** - Enhanced with service workers to work offline or on low quality networks.

* **App-like** - Use the app-shell model to provide app-style navigations and interactions.

* **Fresh** - Always up-to-date thanks to the service worker update process.

* **Safe** - Served via TLS to prevent snooping and ensure content hasn’t been tampered with.

* **Discoverable** - Are identifiable as “applications” thanks to W3C manifests and service worker registration scope allowing search engines to find them.

* **Re-engageable** - Make re-engagement easy through features like push notifications.

* **Installable** - Allow users to “keep” apps they find most useful on their home screen without the hassle of an app store.

* **Linkable** - Easily share via URL and not require complex installation.

## Pros of building PWA's

* Increases engagement on iOS users
* No updates required
* Search engine indexed
* Home screen installation
* Alllow starting smaller and scale
* Better for people with slow phones / connection
* Faster development
* Transition to new stack

## Cons of building PWA's

* Apple's Service workers support
* Microsoft's Push notifications support
* Communication across other apps

## Pros of building Native Apps

* UX experience
* Device capabilities (Access to Calendar, Music...etc.)

## Cons of building Native Apps

* Not easy to discover
* Need to be downloaded
* Manage app stores (Licensing, updates...etc.)
* Learning curve on new technologies
* Native can be transitional, web is always going to be with us
* React Native is still defining itself
* There is 22% reduction on app downloads over browsing web
* Building features "twice" (Maintaining web and native at the same time)
